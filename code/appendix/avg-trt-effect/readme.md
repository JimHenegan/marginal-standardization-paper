# Average Treatment Effect

## Among the Treated and Untreated

This folder contains scripts that show how to compute 

- the average treatment effect among the treated and 
- the average treatment effect among the untreated

using Stata.

One script ([`01-average-treatment-effect-by-hand.do`](./01-average-treatment-effect-by-hand.do)) shows how to compute these estimates "by hand."  

The other ([`02-average-treatment-effect-with-margins.do`](./02-average-treatment-effect-with-margins.do)) shows how to compute the estimates Stata's `margins` command.
