# Compute Numbers for Figure 3

This folder contains a Stata script ([`numbers-for-figure-3.do`](./numbers-for-figure-3.do)) that indicates how one might get the numbers used in figure 3.

## Table of Comparisons

The script uses the synthetic data provided by the repository, so the numbers produced by the script may differ from the ones presented in the paper. The table below compares the results from the paper with the results from the synthetic data.
